# Exprer

Exprer is a expression evaluator. It can recieve plus, minus,
division, multiplication and power expressions, respecting the order.

To use it, run `python3 main.py` and digit your expression following the rules:

- It needs to have a space between each character (except for the parenthesis, curly and squared brackets)
- You can use integers and floats
- As said earlier, only plus, minus, division, multiplication and power are allowed for now

once writed, press `enter` to recieve the result.
